# üìà Stock Market Analysis & Forecasting Dashboard

A comprehensive Tableau dashboard project providing **in-depth analysis, behavioral insights, and predictive forecasting** of stock price movements, volume patterns, corporate actions, and technical signals across a multi-brand stock market dataset. This project empowers users to make more informed investment and trading decisions.

-----

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is designed to be a one-stop solution for understanding stock market dynamics. It goes beyond mere historical reporting by integrating **24+ advanced financial metrics** categorized into crucial areas:

  * **Price Trends:** Uncovering long-term and short-term directional movements.
  * **Volume Patterns:** Analyzing trading activity to gauge market conviction.
  * **Dividends & Splits:** Understanding the impact of corporate actions on returns.
  * **Corporate Events:** Tracking significant company-specific changes.
  * **Behavioral Proxies:** Identifying human sentiment and trading psychology.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

  * **SQL (SQL Server)**: Employed for comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and complex calculations including window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and aggregation, ensuring data integrity and performance.
  * **Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public**: The core visualization tool used for designing interactive dashboards, charts, and incorporating various filters and parameters to allow dynamic exploration of data.
  * **Python (Pandas/Numpy/Scikit-learn/TensorFlow/Keras)**: Utilized (as indicated by LSTM, XGBoost, Random Forest models in forecasts) for advanced statistical analysis, machine learning model training (especially for the `Close Price Forecast` dashboard), and potentially for more intricate data manipulation or custom indicator calculations not easily done in SQL.
  * **GitHub**: Essential for project version control, collaboration, and showcasing the entire data analytics workflow.

| **4. Behavioral Patterns & Trends** | **How does investor behavior influence stock prices for a selected brand over time?** Detects emotion-driven trading opportunities and market risks by highlighting patterns like `buy-the-dip` signals, `panic selling` events, significant `volume spikes`, `volatility surges`, and `anchor gaps`. | Volume Spike Anomalies, Volatility Heatmaps, Buy/Sell Signal Indicators |
| **5. Company Metadata & Macro Insights** | **Which brands and sectors are the most profitable, and what's the global stock distribution?** Helps investors and analysts identify the most profitable brands and sectors, compare capital gains vs. dividends, and explore global stock distribution. Also tracks corporate evolutions like mergers or ticker changes. | Capital Gains by Industry, Global Stock Distribution Maps, Brand-level KPIs |
| **6. Technical Indicators** | **What are the key price action, volume, and technical patterns for a brand, and can they signal trading opportunities?** Visualizes essential technical indicators such as RSI (Relative Strength Index), VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price), rolling returns, Moving Average (MA) crossovers, and candlestick patterns (e.g., Bullish Engulfing, Bearish). Critical for spotting trading signals and gauging technical health. | RSI Charts, VWAP with "Sustained Buying", MA Crossover Signals, OHLC Candlestick with Bullish/Bearish labels, Gap Up/Down Analysis, Breakout After Inside Bar |
| **7. Close Price Forecast** | **Which machine learning model provides the most accurate forecast for future stock close prices?** Compares predictive outcomes from **LSTM**, **XGBoost**, and **Random Forest** models. Displays historical (blue line) and forecasted (orange line) close prices for a selected stock, allowing for direct evaluation of each model's predictive accuracy and trend outlooks. This dashboard is crucial for forward-looking investment strategies. | Line Charts showing Historical vs. Forecasted Prices for LSTM, XGBoost, and Random Forest Models |
